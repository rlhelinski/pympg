Gas Mileage PHP Database, by Ryan Helinski
gas_mileage.php, version 0.7

Coming Soon: Export to spreadsheet format

since 0.6:
* Fixed all the warnings/notices that were being generated but not printed
  unless enabled by the PHP server. This just makes the code more robust,
  and may have fixed a few potential bugs.

* This also included adding defaults for the add record form a format
  which allows the fields to be non-empty in the case there was no 
  corresponding post data. In other words, the fields could have example
  values by default and a javascript could clear that value upon a click
  so the user doesn't have to erase anything. Not interesting to me yet.

    since 0.5:
    Added a new plot function, which calls a gnuplot script and converts the 
    eps to png for display. Requires "gnuplot" and libgp.

    since 0.4: 
	added data conversion/formatting for form input
	various bug fixes and added statistics

    since 0.3: added prediction of next service interval and fixed bugs,
               added Station field
    since 0.2: added date conversion to UTC and math for time
               validated math with spreadsheet
    since 0.1: added password protection for adding records
