Gas Mileage PHP Database, by Ryan Helinski
Version:1.0

Legend: (*) denotes not done, (.) denotes done, (x) denotes canceled

goals for post-1.0: 
.	Export to spreadsheet (CSV) format(s)
.	Added CSS to Makefile rule
.	Changed mode of datafiles.txt in install rule
*	Restructure classes to allow flat-file storage code to be easily replaced
	*	Complete the filedb class
	*	Complete the gnuplotctl class

goals for 1.0:
. Object-oriented, modular code with little repetition
. Cascading style sheet (CSS) integrated into code
. Better look (by style) of alerts to draw attention
	. Green notices and red alerts would be great
. Notes should have a pop-up bubbles

since 0.6:
. Fixed all the warnings/notices that were being generated but not printed
  unless enabled by the PHP server. This just makes the code more robust,
  and may have fixed a few potential bugs.

. This also included adding defaults for the add record form a format
  which allows the fields to be non-empty in the case there was no 
  corresponding post data. In other words, the fields could have example
  values by default and a javascript could clear that value upon a click
  so the user doesn't have to erase anything. Not interesting to me yet.

since 0.5:
.   Added a new plot function, which calls a gnuplot script and converts the 
    eps to png for display. Requires "gnuplot" and libgp.

.   since 0.4: 
	added data conversion/formatting for form input
	various bug fixes and added statistics

.   since 0.3: added prediction of next service interval and fixed bugs,
               added Station field
.   since 0.2: added date conversion to UTC and math for time
               validated math with spreadsheet
.   since 0.1: added password protection for adding records
