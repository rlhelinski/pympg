To install:

Step 1:
	Check that you have PHP4 or PHP5 installed working. Create a directory where you can host the PHP scripts, and verify a simple script works. 

Step 2: 
	Get the files

	From a release,	untar the release file:
	tar -xvjf pgmdb-release-x.tar.bz2 

	OR

	From SVN, checkout the files:
	svn co http://pgmdb.sf.net/svnroot/pgmdb/trunk

Step 3:
	Call make to set up permissions and files necessary for operation:
	make install

	Review and edit the local settings file:
	localSettings.php

Step 4:
	Hopefully, you're done. 

	If things don't work, make sure you check the error log of your web server (for Apache, this is at /var/log/httpd/error_log or /var/log/apache2/error_log). 
	You may also enable the output of the PHP errors in your 'php.ini' file to save you the extra effort of checking the log file (note this might be a security concern for you). 
	If all else fails, e-mail me.
