#### History

1.0 Plan:

	PyMPG class is broken into at least two classes
	Implement user preferences saved in file
	Implement vehicle properties saved in file
	Reduce/eliminate hard-coded numbers and strings in code
	
	I guess that doing an integer lookup and comparing with a string is faster
	than finding the index of a string, which involves n string comparisons, and 
	then comparing the index to a number. 

# Version 0.5:
# Improved record loading/creating procedure to ensure dates are sorted
# Improved record edit dialog: 
#  * Doesn't modify file unless record is actually change. 
#  * Uses the GTK 'activate' signal (when enter is pressed) or the 'focus-out-event' (when tab is pressed) to update 
#  * Dropped 'changed' signal, was too frequent
# Implemented "Save before closing?" dialog 
# Added save current plot to file, properly using the push and pop terminal commands in GNUPLOT
# Added clicking on rows in TreeView (the table) adds a correspoinding point and redraws the open plot 
# 	upon click of row, highlight that data point in the plot, if open. 
# Added running miles/year, which uses only the last year.
# Cleaned up some commented-out code
# Shade alternating rows 
# implemented export to GNUPLOT waveform
# Now handles not filling up for one record. Should be extended to any number. 
#
# TODO 
# implement "hidden" records in the CSV file for things like make, model, fuel tank size, etc.
#
# Version 0.4:
# Better behavior under condition of more than one fill-up per day. 
# In Edit Window, fields are now updated whenever changed. In old behavior,
# user had to hit "enter" to update the record for each field. 
# Added Miles Per Year (MPY) to summary.
# Improved structure of summary window code, it's now a table generated by a loop.
#
# Version 0.3:
# Fixed some references that were broken with strftime() and strptime()
# Implement 'sort by date' on 'add new record', in case new record is old
#
# Version 0.2:
# fixed old file remaining on open or new file action
# fixed accelerator keys
# fixed menu items not being disabled (new record when no file open)
# implement new file function DONE
# add about dialog DONE
# implement dirty_bit for tracking if file is modified DONE
# create function for setting the main window title DONE
# disable 'save' until dirty_bit -> 1 DONE
#
# Version 0.1:
# add derived fields but not store them anywhere (neat) DONE
# implement file save function DONE
# implement summary window DONE
# implement add new record dialog DONE
# implement delete record DONE
# implement edit record dialog DONE
