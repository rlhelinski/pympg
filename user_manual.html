<h1>PHP Gas-Mileage Database</h1> 

<p>PGMDB is a minimalistic web application designed to be easy to install, and easy to use.
Please read this guide before using the application to become familiar with how it works.</p> 

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<h3>Create a vehicle file</h3>

<p>Choose the "create" option from the database function drop-down menu. Click "Submit Query". Enter a new filename, and a password for adding records. Fill out the rest of the information and click "Submit Query". </p>

<h3>Create refueling records</h3>

<p>Now you may start adding refueling records using the "add record" option from the database function drop-down menu.</p>

<h3>Viewing Records</h3>

<p>There at least three different record views:</p>

<ul>
<li>Detailed View</li>
<li>Print View</li>
<li>Plot View</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Detailed View</strong> &nbsp; This is the view that is normally used. 
It has three major section: records and derived statistics (those that aren't 
stored in the file), a summary (statistics highlights section), and a detailed 
statistics section with many interesting facts (min/avg/max/latest).</p>

<p><strong>Print View</strong> &nbsp; This the view that should be used to 
print out the records for archival. Only the important information is displayed 
to save paper.</p>

<p><strong>Plot View</strong> &nbsp; This view helps you see trends. It 
requires <tt>gnuplot</tt> to be installed and accessable by your web server.</p>

<h2>How the Math Works</h2>

<p>Here's the basic assumption: the amount of fuel that it takes to fill your 
tank is the amount of fuel that was spent since the last time the tank was 
filled. Therefor, if you fill each time, then the latest mile/gallon estimate
is just the distance you travelled (difference of odometer readings) divided by
the amount of fuel you purchased.</p>
